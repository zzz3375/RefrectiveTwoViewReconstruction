# RefrectiveTwoViewReconstruction
This is Zhizhang Zhou's attempt to repeat experiments of "Refractive Two-View Reconstruction for Underwater 3D Vision" https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-019-01218-9

## Data
The Data folder contains experiment facilities and image pairs obtained by the experiments.
The glass water container for refraction has a size of 150 * 150 * 200 mm^3.
The chessboard has a size of 18.7 * 18.7 mm^2 per black or white square.

## view1 and view2
The view1 and view2 contain calibration code of the 2 cameras in the experiment, also along with error checking with piror conditions.
